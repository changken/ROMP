| ROMP is a **one-stage** method for monocular multi-person 3D mesh recovery in **real time**. | BEV further explores multi-person **depth relationships** and supports **all age groups**. | TRACE further **tracks specific subjects** and recover their **global 3D trajectory with dynamic cameras**. |

## Getting started

Please use simple-romp for inference, the rest code is just for training.

## How to use it

#### For ROMP & BEV, please refer to [this guidance](https://github.com/Arthur151/ROMP/blob/master/simple_romp/README.md) for inference & export (fbx/glb/bvh).
#### For TRACE, please refer to [this instrcution](simple_romp/trace2/README.md).

### Train
For training, please refer to [installation.md](docs/installation.md) for full installation.
Please prepare the training datasets following [dataset.md](docs/dataset.md), and then refer to [train.md](docs/train.md) for training. 

### Evaluation

For evaluation on benchmarks, please refer to [romp_evaluation](docs/romp_evaluation.md), [bev_evaluation](docs/bev_evaluation.md), and [trace_evaluation](simple_romp/trace2/README.md).

### Extensions

[[Blender addon]](https://github.com/yanchxx/CDBA): [Yan Chuanhang](https://github.com/yanchxx) created a Blender-addon to drive a 3D character in Blender using ROMP from image, video or webcam input.

[[VMC protocol]](https://codeberg.org/vivi90/vmcps): [Vivien Richter](https://github.com/vivi90) implemented a VMC (Virtual Motion Capture) protocol support for different Motion Capture solutions with ROMP. 

### Docker usage

Please refer to [docker.md](docs/docker.md)

### Bugs report

Welcome to submit issues for the bugs.
